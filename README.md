Our solution is especially designed to help the elderly and those who may find it challenging to distinguish fact from fiction in the digital landscape.

## üåü Key Features

## üîç How It Works

CheckFirstLeh uses an Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach that follows these steps:

1. **Query Reception**: When a user submits a question or statement to verify
2. **Real-Time Information Retrieval**: The system actively searches trusted sources for relevant information
3. **Web Scraping & Vectorization**: Content from reliable sources is scraped and converted into vector representations for efficient semantic comparison
4. **Contextual Retrieval**: The most semantically relevant documents are retrieved from the vector database
5. **Enhanced Decision-Making**: The LLM combines retrieved factual information with its understanding to generate accurate verification
6. **Transparent Results**: Users receive a clear verdict along with the sources used and reasoning behind the decision
